This package contains a number of utilities which are designed to make working with the data products from gravitational-wave catalogues, such as [GWTC-4.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18082).

At present it allows you to produce plots similar to the ones in that paper, and to interact with [asimov](https://github.com/ligo-asimov/asimov), which is a tool used to produce catalogue-scale parameter estimation in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.
